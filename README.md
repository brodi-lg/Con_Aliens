# ConAliens - First Solo Project 


## About the project
In this project, I try to gauge engagement for categories of conspiracies that I developed manually based on tags attached to individual videos from a very popular conspiracy and urban legends Youtube channe. This channel has set itself apart for its fact checking and storytelling. 
I chose Youtube as my field as studies have shown that the comment engagement on Youtube mimic traits of participatory culture including traits of 'intense collective sense-making and knowledge production'. Second given that disinformation is a collective socially produced act, the larger aim of the project would be to gauge government skepticism across conspiracy theory categories but this is outside the scope of this attempt. 

## AIM: This simple project only is limited to show the popularity of conspiracy categories and provide a visual comparison. My initial hypothesis was that alien/ufo conspiracies would be most popular as they are also connected to government skepticism and was prompted by the flurry of discussions across social media platforms around the recent US Congress revelations and open investigations into UAPs. All data was gathered through the Youtube API.

## Difficulties
 1. Simplifying codes and functions 
 2. Exploring correlations
 3. Making the visualisations more attractive.
 

## Conclusions
1. Alien and UFO conspiracies consistently appeared in the top three in terms of views, counts, and likes but it was not the top category.
2. However, to gauge its importance in the scheme of conspiracies and skepticism towards governments, a qualitative comment analysis or sentiment analysis is required. This would reveal deeper motivations and even throw up correlations. 
3. The high interest in urban legends and unsolved mysteries could be a further area of study and research - what does this mean for the growing skepticism around mainstream narratives? 

#Postscript:
My cleaning might not be up to par. But this was a fun first attempt!
